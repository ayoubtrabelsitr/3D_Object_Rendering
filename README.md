# 3D Object Visualization with Cook-Torrance Model
 Advanced 3D Object Rendering with Cook-Torrance Shading

This project aims to develop a 3D object visualization tool using the Cook-Torrance shading model.

Key points include:

1. **Implementation of Cook-Torrance Model**: Modify existing HTML and JavaScript code to incorporate the Cook-Torrance shading model with Beckmann distribution and Torrance-Sparrow attenuation factor.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development**: Create an HTML GUI to control light source positioning, color/power, and BRDF parameters.

3. **Optional: Anisotropic Shading**: Implement anisotropic shading using the Ward model for materials with directional reflectance properties.

4. **Integration of Environment Maps**: Develop support for environment maps to enhance the visual realism of rendered objects.

5. **Fresnel Mirrors and Transparency**: Implement reflection and transmission calculations based on Snell-Descartes laws and Fresnel factors to simulate mirrors and transparent surfaces.

6. **Testing and Optimization**: Thoroughly test and optimize the rendering of mirrors, transparency effects, and overall performance of the application.
